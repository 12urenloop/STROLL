# STROLL: System Tracking Runners On Langdurige Loopwedstrijden

STROLL is a shell script that will be the replacement of the
[gyrid](https://github.com/12urenloop/gyrid) software that runs on the old gyrids.
It's meant to be run on the new Espressobin platform. The main function of STROLL is
to send data about nearby bluetooth devices (MAC address and RSSI) to
[count-von-count](https://github.com/12urenloop/cvc).


This repo will also contain information about how to setup the Espressobins.
